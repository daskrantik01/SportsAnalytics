# Here's a summary of the document:

### 1. Introduction: 
The report begins by introducing the problem statement. The authors aim to predict the outcomes of FC Barcelona's football matches in the 2020-2021 La Liga season using a Markov Chain model. They consider the results of the past three matches and make certain assumptions for their model.
Data: The document includes a table of data showing the first ten match results, including dates, match points, and state annotations based on past results. It is mentioned that there are a total of 22 unique state spaces observed for Barcelona in the 2020-21 season.
### 2. Methodology:
### 3. State Spaces: 
We tried to create a sequence of state spaces based on match results and define possible state spaces for their model.
Transition Probability Matrix: A transition probability matrix is constructed using the provided data. The matrix represents the probabilities of transitioning from one state space to another.
### 4. Visualization of Transition Probability Matrix: 
A heatmap is used to visualize the transition probability matrix.
MCMC Simulation using Gibbs Sampling: The Gibbs sampling method is used to sample prior and posterior distributions for the Markov Chain. The prior and posterior distributions are obtained and visualized.
### 5. Convergence: 
Convergence of the Markov Chain is checked using a trace plot, which suggests that the algorithm has converged to a stable distribution.
Stationarity: Stationarity is verified through eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The stationary distribution is computed, and it's shown that the chain reaches stationarity at a specific time period.
### 6. Results: 
The report lists various results and observations, such as the convergence of the model, uniqueness of the stationary distribution, and the time period at which the Markov Chain becomes stationary.
### 7. Inference: 
The document concludes by making inferences from the results, stating that past three performances are sufficient to predict future matches' outcomes, and the model reaches stationarity after 44 matches.

### Transition Probability Matrix (P)

The transition probability from state \(i\) to state \(j\) is calculated as:

\[
P_{ij} = \frac{\text{Number of transitions from state } i \text{ to state } j}{\text{Total transitions from state } i}
\]

### Prior and Posterior Distributions

The prior distribution (\( \pi^{(n+1)} \)) is updated as follows:

\[
\pi^{(n+1)} = \pi^{(n)} \cdot P
\]

After observing a new match result (e.g., \(W\)), you can update the prior distribution to get the posterior distribution:

\[
\pi^{(n+1)} = \pi^{(n)} \cdot P_j
\]

### Stationary Distribution (\( \pi^* \))

The stationary distribution (\( \pi^* \)) is calculated by solving the equation:

\[
\pi^* \cdot P = \pi^*
\]
